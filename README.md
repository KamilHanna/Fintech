##Project 1 â€“ Client Segmentation of bank clients
Unsupervised learning techniques were used to segment banking clients based on behavioral and financial features. The project involved dimensionality reduction (UMAP, PCA, t-SNE), clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, MiniSom), and statistical validation (MANOVA, ANOVA) to ensure meaningful and robust segmentation.
